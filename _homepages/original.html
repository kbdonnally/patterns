title: Home
status: in progress
notes:
- About 80% finished
- Needs some styling and probably a custom topnav that's not so obtrusive
- Also none of the links are real -> insert real hrefs
- Standardize font sizing on 1st vs. 2nd half of page
- Test color change thing w/ site theme colors
- Restyle hero section
