>Experimental & digital scholarship in all fields, informed by humanities and cultural heritage approaches
>
We're the UVA Library's lab for experimental and digital research, teaching, and other forms of scholarship, open to all disciplines and anyone curious about getting their hands dirty. 
>
At the Scholars' Lab, our most important scholarship is our community of scholars:
mentors, learners, researchers, teachers, crafters & makers, collaborators.
Come help us explore what that meansâ€”we'd love you to be a part of our community! 
>
We use humanities and cultural heritage approaches to solve problems in any discipline/field
