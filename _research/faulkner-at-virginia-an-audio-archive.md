Professor Stephen Railton, with assistance from the Scholars' Lab, created the [Faulkner at Virginia](http://faulkner.lib.virginia.edu/) archive. Here you can listen in on William Faulkner’s sessions with audiences at the University of Virginia in 1957 and 1958, during his two terms as UVA’s first Writer-in-Residence.
