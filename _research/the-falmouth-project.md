Louis P. Nelson of the UVa Department of Architectural History authored [The Falmouth Project](http://falmouth.lib.virginia.edu/), an online geo-spatially accessible archive of information about the historic architecture of Falmouth, Jamaica.

The archive includes information on the 764 buildings that fall within the boundaries of the historic district. Every building in the archive has a full PDF survey report that includes a summary of the building’s form and materials, a supposition about the building’s date of construction, an assessment of the building’s condition in 2008, and a photograph and approximate footprint.
