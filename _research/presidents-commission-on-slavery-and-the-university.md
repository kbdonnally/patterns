In 2013, UVa President Theresa Sullivan formed the [President's Commission on Slavery and the University](http://slavery.virginia.edu/). The Scholarsâ€™ Lab assisted the Commission by creating a web site so their explorations of the historical relationships between the University of Virginia, slavery, and enslaved people could be publicly shared. In addition, the Scholars' Lab continues to consult on digital exhibits and projects related to the mission.
