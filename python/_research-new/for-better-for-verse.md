A collaboration with UVA English professor Herbert Tucker, [For Better for Verse](http://prosody.lib.virginia.edu) tests users' understanding of prosody, or poetic meter in English-language poetry. In the over 40 included poems, users can mark syllable stress, foot divisions, and even check answers. Intended primarily for teaching purposes, For Better for Verse allows students to explore poems of varying difficulty and complexity.

The application embeds a core JSP, XSLT, and Javascript application within a Wordpress installation. The poems are encoded using the [TEI](http://tei-c.org) P5 standards.
