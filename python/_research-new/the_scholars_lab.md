The Scholars' Lab is itself digital humanities scholarship: an active exploration of a DH research center advancing an ethic of care both outwardly and internally. From putting our budget dollars behind our values, to team-authoring a charter, to internal policies that support work-life balance, we're working to both improve and document practices toward achieving a humane, ethical, and generative digital humanities community. 

In the future, we'll collect on this page a list of blog posts, presentations, and other ways of making this scholarship public.
